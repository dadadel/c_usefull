c_usefull
=========

Here are some very basic usefull C functions that I had to recode many times. 
So I put them here to be able to use them easily. Furthermore, it could be usefull for anyone interested.

Ther are functions for string manipulating as striping, change to lower or upper case, search a pattern.
