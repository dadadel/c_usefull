c_usefull
=========

Here are some usefull C functions that I had to recode many times. 
So I put them here to be able to use them easily. Furthermore, it could be usefull for anyone interested.

The provided functions concern:

- string_manip:

Provides functions for string manipulating as striping, changing to lower or upper case, searching a pattern.

- basic_list:

Provides basic chained list functions (init, add_element, release resources)
